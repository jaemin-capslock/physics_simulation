# physics_simulation
Physics simulations crafted for the AP Physics C class.

The [Matplotlib tutorials](https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/contents.html), particularly the ones with animation were primarily referred. For calculating and deriving the air resistance of an projectile, [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion#Solution_by_numerical_integration) was primarily referred. The animating part and it's implementation to Google Colab was done on my own.

June 5th, 2020 - Currently capable of simulating projectile motion with air resistance.

Future plans
- Display multiple trajectories at once
- Model with Magnus effect included
- "Real-life" examples : Baseball? Tennis? Bat swing (with conservation of momentum?)
- More cleaner model in general
