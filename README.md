# physics_simulation
Physics simulations crafted for the AP Physics C class.

The [Matplotlib tutorials](https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/contents.html), particularly the ones with animation were primarily referred. For calculating and deriving the air resistance of an projectile, [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion#Solution_by_numerical_integration) was primarily referred. The animating part and it's implementation to Google Colab was done on my own.
